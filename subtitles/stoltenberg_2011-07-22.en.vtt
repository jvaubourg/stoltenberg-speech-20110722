00:00:00.238 --> 00:00:07.593
Today, Norway has been hit by two shocking, violent and cowardly attacks.

2
00:00:08.735 --> 00:00:13.603
We don’t know who has attacked us. There is much that remains uncertain.

3
00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:18.351
But we do know that many have died and many are injured.

4
00:00:19.018 --> 00:00:25.183
We are all shocked by the evil events that struck so suddenly and brutally.

5
00:00:26.777 --> 00:00:30.961
This is an evening that will demand a great deal of us all.

6
00:00:31.704 --> 00:00:35.656
The next days may be more demanding still.

7
00:00:36.846 --> 00:00:39.968
We are prepared to face them.

8
00:00:40.321 --> 00:00:43.106
Norway stands together in times of crisis.

9
00:00:43.915 --> 00:00:47.247
We mourn our dead.

10
00:00:48.033 --> 00:00:53.222
We share the sufferings of those who are wounded. And we feel with the families and friends of those affected.

11
00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:59.030
This is an attack on innocent civilians.

12
00:00:59.982 --> 00:01:02.617
On young people at a summer camp.

13
00:01:03.124 --> 00:01:04.314
On us.

14
00:01:05.718 --> 00:01:10.490
J'ai un message pour ceux qui nous ont attaqués.

15
00:01:10.935 --> 00:01:13.163
Ainsi que ceux qui sont derrière eux.

16
00:01:13.787 --> 00:01:17.020
It is a message from the whole of Norway:

17
00:01:17.715 --> 00:01:20.238
You will not destroy us.

18
00:01:21.642 --> 00:01:28.259
You will not destroy our democracy or our commitment to bringing about a better world.

19
00:01:29.116 --> 00:01:33.079
We are a small nation, but we are a proud nation.

20
00:01:35.114 --> 00:01:37.948
No one is going to bomb us into silence.

21
00:01:38.732 --> 00:01:41.514
No one is going to shoot us into silence.

22
00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:47.277
No one is ever going to frighten us away from being Norway.

23
00:01:49.705 --> 00:01:55.132
This evening and tonight we will take care of one another.

24
00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.392
Comfort one another, talk, and stand together.

25
00:02:02.487 --> 00:02:08.619
Tomorrow we will show the world that the Norwegian democracy grows stronger when it is under pressure.

26
00:02:10.556 --> 00:02:14.246
We will find the perpetrators and bring them to justice.

27
00:02:15.674 --> 00:02:24.957
The most important task this evening is to save lives and take care of all who have been hurt and their families.

28
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:35.616
I pay tribute to the police, health workers and others who have put in a formidable effort over the last few hours

29
00:02:35.716 --> 00:02:40.024
to help people and prevent more harm being done.

30
00:02:45.838 --> 00:02:50.919
We must never give up our values.

31
00:02:51.837 --> 00:02:56.352
We must show that our open society can pass this test too.

32
00:02:57.047 --> 00:03:01.660
That the answer to violence is even more democracy.

33
00:03:02.684 --> 00:03:05.195
Even more humanity.

34
00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.087
But never naivity.

35
00:03:08.658 --> 00:03:11.848
That is something we owe the victims and their families.
